capstone:

Import Python module capstone
Initialize Python class for Capstone with class "Cs"
Disassemble the binary code with method disasm() of the class Cs class instance

#----------------------------------------

compiler: 32 bit x86

gcc -m32 file.c
gcc -m32 -w -static file.c

it seems like in an elf file the executable code in in .text section

also if run strip on the binaries the output will be different
