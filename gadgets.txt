With ROP, it is possible to do far more powerful things than calling a single function.
In fact, we can use it to run arbitrary code6 rather than just calling functions we have available to us.
We do this by returning to gadgets, which are short sequences of instructions ending in a ret.
For example, the following pair of gadgets can be used to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location:

pop %ecx
pop %eax
ret

mov %eax, (%ecx)
ret

#----------------------------------------

pop ; ret
pop ; pop ; ret
xor eax, eax ; ret
