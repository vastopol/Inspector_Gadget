With ROP, it is possible to do far more powerful things than calling a single function.
In fact, we can use it to run arbitrary code rather than just calling functions we have available to us.
We do this by returning to gadgets, which are short sequences of instructions ending in a ret.
For example, the following pair of gadgets can be used to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location:

pop %ecx
pop %eax
ret

mov %eax, (%ecx)
ret

#----------------------------------------

some to look for:

pop ; ret
pop ; pop ; ret
xor eax, eax ; ret
mov eax, eax ; ret
mov eax, eax ; mov eax,eax ; ret

#----------------------------------------

gadget catalogs (some types of gadegts)

LOAD    Load value to register
    mov eax, ebp
    mov eax, 0xd7
    mov eax, [edx]

STORE Store to memory
    mov [ebx], edi
    mov [ebx], 0x3f

ADJUST Adjust reg/mem
    add ecx, 9
    add ecx, esi

CALL Call a function
    call [esi]
    call [0x8400726]

SYSCALL Systemcall for *nix
    int 0x80
    sysenter

#----------------------------------------

- Loading a constant into register:
Loading a constant into register will save a value on stack to a register using the POP instruction for later use.
POP eax; ret;
What this will do is pop the value on the stack to eax and then return to the address on top of stack.

- Loading from memory:
Will enable us to load from memory for example the instruction mov ecx,[eax]; ret
Will move the value located in the address stored in eax, to ecx.

- Storing into memory
Will store value in register into a memory location.
Mov [eax],ecx; ret
Will store the value in ecx to the memory address at eax.

- Arithmetic operations:
This ranges from addition, subtraction, multiplication, exclusive or, & AND. And will help us allot
executing a useful gadget as you will see.
For example:
add eax,0x0b; ret (will add 0x0b to eax)
xor edx,edx; ret (will zero out edx)

- System call:
System call instruction followed by ret will enable us to execute a kernel interrupt (system call) that we
setup using previous gadgets. The system call gadgets are.
int 0x80; ret
call gs:[0x10]; ret

- Gadgets to avoid:
There are some gadgets are better to avoid;
gadgets ending with leave followed by ret basically what leave/ret does is pop ebp; ret. This will mess up our stack frame.
Gadgets ending in pop ebp followed by ret or have the instruction pop ebp. Will also mess up our stack frame.

load:
    mov ; ret
    xchg ; ret
    lea ; ret
store:
    mov ; ret
    xchg ; ret
adjust:
    add ; ret
    sub ; ret
call:
    xchg ; call
syscall:
    int 0x80


possible ??:
imul ; ret

Primitive gadgets (1)
Gadgets mostly evolve around registers, and require registers
    P1: Gadget set register to another register
        Ex: xor eax, eax; or eax, ebx; ret → eax = edx
    P2: Gadget set register to immediate constant (xed concrete value)
        Ex: mov edi, 0x0; lea eax, [edi]; pop edi; ret → eax = 0
Hunting for primitive gadgets (P1 & P2) from the set of collected gadget code & formulas

Primitive gadgets (2)
"Natural" primitive gadgets
    PN1: Gadget set register to another register
        Ex: xor eax, eax; add eax, ebx; ret → eax = edx
    PN2: Gadget set register to immediate constant (xed concrete value)
        Ex: or ebx, 0xffffffff; xchg eax, ebx; ret → eax = 0xffffffff
    "Free" register: POP gadget that set register to value poping out of stack bottom (thus can freely get any constant)
        Ex: # push 0x1234 + pop eax; inc ebx; ret → eax = 0x1234
"Chained" primitive gadgets
    PC1: Gadget set register to another register
        Ex: (lea ecx, [edx]; ret) + (mov eax, edx; ret) → eax = edx
    PC2: Gadget set register to immediate constant (xed concrete value)
        Ex: (or ebx, 0xffffffff; ret) + (xchg eax, ebx; ret) → eax = 0xffffffff
    PC3: Equation-derived gadget: Gadget derived from computed equation, and require constraint to achieve target gadget
        Ex: (imul ecx, [esi], 0x0; ret) + (add ecx, eax; ret) → ecx = eax
